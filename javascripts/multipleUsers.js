// Create an object in your JavaScript that holds an array of names (see example below).


var users = {
	names: ["Zeus", "Hercules", "Thor", "Athena", "Beowulf", "Poseidon", "Hades"];
};


// When a user enters a message, it should be prepended with the chosen user's name, in bold text.
// Keep in mind that this will likely change the structure of your JSON file since the pre-loaded messages have to have this information on them.
